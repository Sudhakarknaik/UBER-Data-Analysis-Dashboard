5. üß© Business Problem

  As Uber continues to expand its ride-hailing services across regions, understanding customer behavior, location demand, and trip trends    becomes crucial. However, the raw trip data lacks a structured format for insights, making it difficult for stakeholders to:

 - Identify **high-demand pickup and drop-off locations**
 - Monitor **peak trip hours** and **trip frequency patterns**
 - Analyze **trip distances** to optimize driver allocation
 - Evaluate **location-level performance** to improve service coverage
 - Detect **inefficiencies or bottlenecks** in trip operations

  Without an analytical dashboard, decision-makers face challenges in tracking KPIs, making data-driven decisions, and scaling operations    effectively.

6. üìà Outcome & Business Impact
